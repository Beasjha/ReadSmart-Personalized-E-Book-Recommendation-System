# ReadSmart-Personalized-E-Book-Recommendation-System
It currently implements two recommendation strategies:
‚Ä¢Top Rated ‚Äì Selects the highest-rated books in the chosen genre.
‚Ä¢Similarity Based ‚Äì Finds books similar to a user‚Äôs favorite title using TF-IDF text similarity.

üöÄ Features
Filter books by genre and minimum average rating.
Two Recommendation Strategies:
Strategy A: Top-rated books in a chosen genre.
Strategy B: Similar books to a given title (TF-IDF + cosine similarity).
Handles partial title matches to improve search accuracy.
Easily extendable for future integration of A/B testing.

üóÇ Dataset
Source: Goodreads Dataset on Kaggle
Columns used:
--book_id ‚Äì Unique identifier for the book
--title ‚Äì Book title
--authors ‚Äì Author(s) of the book
--average_rating ‚Äì Average Goodreads rating
--genre ‚Äì Manually added column for book genres

üìÇ Project Workflow ‚Äì ReadSmart
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
Downloaded Goodreads dataset from Kaggle (books.csv).
Selected relevant columns:
title
authors
average_rating
Manually added genre column to classify books into categories (Fantasy, Mystery, Romance, etc.).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
Loaded dataset using Pandas.
Checked for missing values and cleaned where necessary.
Converted genre and title values to lowercase for consistent matching.
Ensured average_rating was numeric for filtering.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Strategy A ‚Äì Top Rated Recommendation
Input: Preferred genre and minimum rating.
Process:
Filter the dataset by chosen genre.
Filter further by average_rating >= min_rating.
Sort results by rating in descending order.
Return the top N highest-rated books.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Strategy B ‚Äì Similarity-Based Recommendation
Input: Favorite book title and genre.
Process:
Filter the dataset by chosen genre.
Create a text field combining title and authors.
Use TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numerical features.
Compute cosine similarity between all books in that genre.
Recommend the top N most similar books to the input title.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Output
Display recommendations for both strategies:
Strategy A: Table of top-rated books.
Strategy B: Table of similar books.
